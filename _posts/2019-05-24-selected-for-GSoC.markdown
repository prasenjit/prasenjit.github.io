Its around a month and a half since my last post. Finding out time for blogging between the semester exams was really tough, given that I had a lot of syllabus to cover and revise before the exams, and also going through the code of `Falkon` and communicating with my mentor. Yes, I finally got selected for Google Summer of Code 2019. I would be working for `KDE Community` on the application `Falkon`.

`Falkon` is a Qt based web browser. My project proposal was to give it the ability to synchronise its user data with another instance of itself, using Firefox Accounts Server. As of now, it can't sync user data like history, bookmarks, etc. All major browser (Mozilla Firefox for example) can do that. I would be working 3 months this summer to give `Falkon` that ability.

The journey of these 3 months of Coding Period is going to be exciting. I will keep posting about my progress here.
